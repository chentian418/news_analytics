    "# Convert to Dataframe Using Multiprocessing Pool\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is a useful python package that enables the user to utilize multiple processors on a given machine for more efficient progress. The Pool object allows data parallelism--making the function execution of multiple input values more convenient through split processes. This sample script displays the use of Multiprocessing Pool in parsing large numbers of XML files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is preferred when calling functions on larger sets of data. The concept of data-parallelism allows independent processes to run simultaneously without having to communicate with other processes to perform the particular function on its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script displays the use of multiprocessing in parsing the xml files. It creates the function for parsing, creates a pool object, then calls the function using that pool object to run multiprocessing.\n",

       " '\\nDanita Sienknecht was on a car ride with her husband one recent morning when a stranger called her with an outlandish offer. If she wired him $4,000 overnight, someone would show up at her door the next morning with two doses of a coveted coronavirus vaccine she knew doesn\\'t exist.\\nThe caller, who knew her name, said he was at a Holiday Inn not far from her southwest Missouri home and told the 84-year-old to send the money right away. He called her 29 more times when she refused to call back.\\n\"I knew I had to report it,\" Ms. Sienknecht said.\\nAuthorities are being flooded with complaints as scammers try to cash in on the nation\\'s panic over \\nthe coronavirus\\nby peddling fake cures, soliciting donations to phony charities and selling needed items like masks, hand sanitizer and toilet paper at jacked-up prices.\\nThe Federal Trade Commission said on Monday it had received at least 7,283 complaints of \\ncoronavirus-related scams\\nin the first three months of the year, with $4.6 million in reported losses.\\n\"I don\\'t think I have ever been as busy as I have been since early February,\" said Colleen Tressler, a consumer education specialist with the FTC, who has been urging people to pause and consider offers of help or promises of treatment before opening their wallets or clicking unusual links.\\nThe agency, whose mission is to protect people from fraud and deception, so far has sent warning letters to at least seven businesses that authorities said were hawking products that falsely claim to treat coronavirus, such as teas, essential oils and colloidal silver.\\nElsewhere, a Brooklyn man, Baruch Feldheim, 43 years old, was arrested Monday for allegedly coughing on FBI agents while claiming to have coronavirus as they were investigating his stockpiling and sale of surgical masks, N-95 respirators and medical gowns. Prosecutors said he sold the items to doctors and nurses, sometimes at a 700% markup.\\nFBI agents on Monday also arrested Erik Santos, 49 years old, in Georgia after he allegedly solicited and received kickbacks from testing companies in exchange for referring people for Covid-19 tests they apparently didn\\'t need and Medicare would pay for.\\n\"[W]hile there are people going through what they are going through, you can either go bankrupt or you can prosper,\" he said in a phone call, according to prosecutors. His lawyer couldn\\'t immediately be reached for comment.\\nIn Michigan, where the state\\'s attorney general has a team of special agents to field price-gouging complaints, authorities said a pair of businesses marketed a patch that they falsely claimed would provide immunity from the virus.\\nNew York\\'s attorney general warned of scammers seeking consumers\\' bank information claiming to be able to provide early access to federal stimulus payments—before President Trump had signed \\nthe $2 trillion economic relief plan\\n.\\nIn Southern California, federal prosecutors said actor Keith Middlebrook, 53, told his millions of Instagram followers he had developed a coronavirus prevention pill and injectable cure before he was arrested last week while delivering the bogus drug to an undercover FBI agent. Prosecutors said he posted a video showing viewers a syringe with a clear liquid and described how his cure worked.\\nCourt records don\\'t list an attorney for Mr. Middlebrook, who couldn\\'t immediately be reached.\\n\"Scammers are just opportunistic people,\" Ms. Tressler of the FTC said. \"They are going to cast as wide of a net as possible and see who gets caught.\"\\nAARP has received reports of a range of scams, including people receiving text messages falsely claiming to be from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asking them to click a link to take a \"coronavirus preparedness test\" that instead downloads malware onto their devices, said Kathy Stokes, the organization\\'s director of fraud prevention programs.\\nOne report to AARP was from Ms. Sienknecht, who said staffers advised her that next time, she should just hang up.\\nNumerous emails direct recipients to donate to fake charities with names such as the Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund.\\nOther schemes are more primitive, like the young woman who calls elderly victims posing as a granddaughter in need of money to pay for coronavirus-related medical bills, Ms. Stokes said.\\nMs. Stokes said none of the people who have called her to report these scams so far have claimed they were duped, but she worries that could change the longer the virus keeps people in isolation. Right now, she said, callers to AARP seem most concerned about keeping in touch with their loved ones and finding ways to stay healthy.\\n\"I fully expect to see a spike in all kinds of scams because we\\'re not on our game right now,\" she said. \"Once we settle into whatever our new normal may be then they will start paying attention.\"\\nStay informed\\nGet a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: \\nSign up here.\\n\\nWrite to Sadie Gurman at \\nsadie.gurman@wsj.com\\n\\nCredit: By Sadie Gurman ',\n",
